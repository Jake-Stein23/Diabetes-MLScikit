# Diabetes-MLScikit
Project involving the analysis of scikit-learn model that analyzed a preloaded dataset regarding diabetes patients through pandas with information such as body mass index, age, and blood pressure. Target data was dropped with  to ensure input prompts would not provide answers while the target and prediction data were organized as the "target" or answer data. A train test split was utilized for the model to be trained on the data, while being promptly tested on after with the elements x_test, x_train, y_test, and ytrain. Weights and biases were baked in through LinearRegression with model.fit with the training data, and MSE and R^2 scores were used to measure the models ability to match predictions. This comparison between the models answer and the predicted, true answer were compared in matplotlib.
