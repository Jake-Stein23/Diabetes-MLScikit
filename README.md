# Diabetes-MLScikit
Project involving the analysis of scikit learn model that analyzed a preloaded diabetes  dataset through pandas with information such as BMI, age, and BP. Target data was dropped to ensure inputs would not provide answers while the target and prediction data were the answers portion with df.drop A train test split was utilized for the model to be trained on the data, while being promptly tested on after with the elements x_test, x_train, y_test, and ytrain. Weights and biases were baked in through LinearRegression with model.fit with the training data, and MSE and R2 were used to measure the models ability to match predictions. This comparison between the models answer and the predicted, true answer were compared in matplotlib.
