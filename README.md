# Diabetes-MLScikit
Project involving the  use of scikit-learn model that analyzed a preloaded dataset regarding diabetes patients via pandas with information such as body mass index, age, and blood pressure. The target data (real answers) and  input training data were separated through df.drop. A train test split was utilized for the model to be trained on the data and tested through x_test, x_train, y_test, and ytrain. Weights and biases were developed through LinearRegression with model.fit with the training data, and Mean Squared Error and R^2 scores were used to measure the models ability to match predictions. This comparison between the models predicted answer and the true answer were visualized in matplotlib.
